## Android basics

### Android notes

- App components:
  - Activity
    - The primary entrypoint when opening the app from the icon, and depending on setting other sources as well, such as:
      - Notifications
      - Widgets
      - Links
    - Activites have UI attached to them, so it's the primary interaction point with the user.
  - Service
    - General-purpose enty point
      - Does not provide UI, could be some of the following:
        - Media playback in the background
        - Data syncing
        - APIs
      - The user is usually not aware of most service components
      - The service runs until it's job is complete
  - Broadcast Reciever
    - Primarily used as the system's entry point from outside, this is where the app recieves commands to perform an action that wasn't directly started by the user
  - Content Provider
    - Database management
    - Data access ot the app from file system
    - Private data streaming

The AndroidManifest.xml contains all of the components the app uses, so it must declare every required component for the system can start the app components.
